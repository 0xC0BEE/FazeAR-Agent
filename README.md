# FazeAR: AI Accounts Receivable Agent

FazeAR is a sophisticated prototype of an AI-native Accounts Receivable (AR) management platform. It demonstrates how a powerful, conversational AI agent can be placed at the center of a complex business workflow, transforming manual tasks into strategic conversations.

The application provides a comprehensive toolset for AR specialists to manage the entire invoice lifecycle, from creation and tracking to client communication and payment processing. The core innovation is its chat-first interface, where users can command the AI agent to perform tasks, analyze data, and generate reports using natural language.
