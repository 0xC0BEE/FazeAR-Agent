# FazeAR: AI Accounts Receivable Agent

Welcome to FazeAR, a powerful, AI-native prototype for modern Accounts Receivable (AR) management. This application demonstrates how a sophisticated, conversational AI agent, powered by the Gemini API, can serve as the central command center for the entire AR workflow, transforming a traditionally manual process into a seamless and strategic conversation.

---

## Project Overview

FazeAR is designed to augment the capabilities of AR professionalsâ€”Collectors, Managers, and Admins. Instead of navigating complex menus and forms, users interact with the FazeAR agent through a natural language chat interface to manage invoices, communicate with clients, analyze financial data, and even automate complex tasks like payment matching and strategic planning.

The application is built with a modern tech stack and showcases a robust, tool-based AI architecture that allows the agent to reliably interact with the application's data and functions.

## Key Features

### Core Application
-   **Role-Based Interface:** The UI and available actions adapt to the user's role (Collector, Manager, Admin).
-   **Comprehensive Workflow Management:** A clean "list-detail" view for tracking and managing every invoice from creation to payment.
-   **Detailed Inspector Panel:** A central hub to view and manage notes, tasks, communication history, and the full audit trail for any selected workflow.
-   **End-to-End Simulation:** On-demand webhook simulation to create new invoices (from "QuickBooks") or process payments (from "Stripe"), allowing for a full lifecycle demo.
-   **Client Payment Portal:** A simple, secure, client-facing webpage for viewing and paying invoices.

### Advanced AI Capabilities
-   **Conversational Command Center:** The central chat interface is the primary way to interact with the application. The agent understands complex, multi-step commands.
-   **AI-Powered Strategic Planning:** Ask the agent "what-if" questions about cash flow (e.g., "What if this client pays 30 days late?") and see the forecast chart update in real-time.
-   **Proactive & Autonomous Operation:** When enabled, the agent runs its own daily cycle to execute routine collection tasks and even propose strategic improvements for manager approval.
-   **Human-AI Collaboration:** The agent can draft professional emails and then iteratively refine them based on user feedback (e.g., "Make this more formal").
-   **Multimodal Document Analysis:** Upload a document (like a PO or invoice) and ask the agent questions about its contents.
-   **Predictive Payment Insights:** The agent can analyze a client's payment history to predict the risk of a late payment on a current invoice.
-   **Interactive Negotiation:** Authorized users can instruct the agent to propose pre-approved settlement offers to clients with long-overdue accounts.
-   **AI-Powered Cash Application:** The agent can parse remittance information from pasted text and automatically match payments to open invoices, presenting the matches for one-click user confirmation.

## User Roles

-   **Collector:** Focused on day-to-day operations. Can manage assigned workflows, add notes and tasks, and use the AI agent to draft communications.
-   **Manager:** Has all collector abilities, plus access to analytics dashboards, performance reports, and the ability to enable Autonomous Mode for the agent.
-   **Admin:** Has full access to all features, including system settings and dunning plan configurations.

## Future Roadmap: Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

The FazeAR platform is built on a scalable foundation. The next phase of development will focus on tackling the most complex challenges in AR:

-   **Automated Deductions & Dispute Management:** Empowering the agent to identify, categorize, and manage customer short payments and disputes.
-   **Interactive Client Collaboration Portal:** Transforming the payment portal into a secure, two-way communication hub where clients can interact directly with a client-facing version of the FazeAR agent.
