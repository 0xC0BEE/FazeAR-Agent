## Agent's Core Purpose

The FazeAR agent is a sophisticated, AI-powered assistant designed to be the central nervous system of the Accounts Receivable (AR) workflow. Its primary goal is to augment the abilities of AR professionals by automating tedious tasks, providing instant data-driven insights, and acting as a proactive, strategic partner. It transforms the AR process from a series of manual clicks and data entry into a seamless, natural language conversation.

## Key Capabilities

The agent's skills are enabled by a robust, tool-based architecture powered by the Gemini API's Function Calling feature. This allows the agent to understand user intent and interact with the application's data and functions in a structured, reliable way.

### 1. Workflow & Data Management

The agent can directly manipulate workflow data based on conversational commands.

*   **Add Notes:** `Add a note to this workflow: 'Client confirmed PO is on its way'.`
*   **Create Tasks:** `Create a task for myself to follow up by phone next Tuesday.`
*   **Retrieve Information:** `What is the total overdue amount for Apex Industries?`

### 2. Communication & Drafting

The agent acts as a collaborative writing partner, capable of drafting professional communications that can be iteratively refined.

*   **Draft Emails:** `Draft a firm but polite second reminder for Quantum Solutions.`
*   **Multi-Language Support:** `Now draft that same email in Spanish.`
*   **Tone Adjustment:** After a draft is created, a user can provide feedback: `Make this friendlier and mention our long-standing partnership.`

### 3. Analytics & Strategic Planning

The agent can analyze application data and help with strategic forecasting.

*   **Conversational Reporting:** `Summarize the current aging report.` or `Who is our top-performing collector this month?`
*   **"What-If" Scenarios:** `What happens to our cash flow forecast if Quantum Solutions and Synergy Corp both pay 30 days late?`
*   **Clear Scenarios:** `Clear the current cash flow scenario.`

### 4. Predictive Insights

The agent can move beyond historical data to provide predictive analysis.

*   **Payment Risk Analysis:** `Analyze the payment risk for this workflow.` The agent will assess the client's history and assign a "Low," "Medium," or "High" risk level.

### 5. Advanced Negotiation

For overdue accounts, authorized users can empower the agent to negotiate.

*   **Settlement Proposals:** `Propose a 5% discount to Quantum Solutions for immediate payment on their overdue balance.`

### 6. Multimodal Document Analysis

The agent can "read" and understand uploaded documents (images or PDFs).

*   **Document Q&A:** After uploading a Purchase Order, a user can ask: `Does the PO number in this document match the workflow?` or `Summarize the line items on this invoice.`

### 7. Proactive & Autonomous Operation

When enabled by a Manager or Admin, the agent can operate independently.

*   **Automated Dunning:** The agent will automatically execute scheduled reminder actions for all workflows.
*   **Strategic Suggestions:** The agent will analyze client payment patterns and propose strategic changes, such as moving a habitually late client to a more aggressive dunning plan. These suggestions are presented in the chat for one-click manager approval.
*   **Reporting:** The agent will post a summary of all actions taken during its autonomous run to the chat for full transparency.

### 8. Enterprise-Grade Automation

The agent can handle complex, enterprise-level AR tasks.

*   **AI-Powered Cash Application:** After a user pastes remittance information, they can command: `Analyze and match these payments.` The agent will parse the text, match payments to invoices, and present a confirmation screen.

## Future Agent Capabilities

The agent's architecture is designed to be extensible. Future development will focus on expanding its expertise into even more complex areas of AR.

*   **Dispute Resolution Analyst:** The agent will learn to identify, categorize, and initiate the resolution process for customer disputes and short payments.
*   **Client Support Concierge:** A secure, client-facing version of the agent will be able to answer client queries directly through an interactive collaboration portal.
