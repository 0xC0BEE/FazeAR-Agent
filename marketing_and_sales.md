# FazeAR: Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

This document outlines a strategic marketing and sales plan for introducing the FazeAR platform to the market.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

FazeAR is not just another AR automation tool; it's a paradigm shift in how finance teams work. Our Go-To-Market strategy will focus on highlighting our core differentiator: a truly **AI-native, conversational user experience**. We will target forward-thinking, tech-savvy small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) who are feeling the pain of manual processes but are underserved by overly complex and expensive enterprise solutions. Our strategy will be rooted in product-led growth (PLG), using the power and intuitiveness of the AI agent itself as our primary sales tool.

## 2. Target Market

**Primary Target:** Small to Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) in North America & Europe.

-   **Company Size:** 25 - 500 employees.
-   **Annual Revenue:** $5M - $100M.
-   **Industry Verticals:** Wholesale Distribution, Manufacturing, Business Services, SaaS, and Media/Advertising. These industries often deal with high volumes of B2B invoices and are susceptible to cash flow challenges.

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**
The "Overwhelmed Finance Leader" at a growing company. This could be a CFO, Controller, or Finance Manager who is:
-   Managing a small team (1-5 people) for AR.
-   Struggling to scale their manual processes (spreadsheets, email follow-ups).
-   Frustrated by the time spent on low-value tasks like payment matching and reminder emails.
-   Tech-savvy and looking for modern, AI-powered solutions to gain a competitive edge.
-   Finds traditional ERP modules to be clunky and legacy enterprise tools to be prohibitively expensive.

## 3. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**"FazeAR is the first AI-native Accounts Receivable platform that transforms your collections process from a manual chore into a strategic conversation. Stop clicking, start commanding."**

### Key Differentiators:
1.  **The Conversational Interface:** Unlike competitors who bolt AI onto a traditional UI, our AI agent *is* the UI. This radically reduces training time and increases operational speed.
2.  **Proactive & Autonomous Agent:** The "set it and forget it" Autonomous Mode is a powerful selling point for lean teams. The agent works 24/7, executing your collection strategy based on fully customizable Dunning Plans.
3.  **Human-AI Collaboration:** FazeAR is built for teams. The agent handles the repetitive tasks, while humans can intervene, add notes, and take over complex cases at any time, with all actions logged in a unified audit trail.
4.  **Democratized Power:** We provide enterprise-grade capabilities like AI-powered Cash Application and Conversational Analytics in a package that is accessible and affordable for SMBs.

## 4. Marketing Plan

### Phase 1: Awareness & Education (Months 1-3)
**Goal:** Build brand awareness and educate the market on the concept of a "conversational and autonomous AI" for AR.

-   **Content Marketing:**
    -   Launch a blog with articles like: "5 Manual AR Tasks You Can Offload to an Autonomous AI," "How to Build a Dunning Strategy that Actually Works," and "Beyond Chatbots: What an AI-Native Finance Tool Looks Like."
    -   Create short, compelling video demos (<60 seconds) for social media showcasing the agent in action (e.g., enabling autonomous mode, customizing a dunning plan, using the cash app tool).
-   **Social Media:** Focus on LinkedIn. Share content, engage in conversations in finance and accounting groups, and connect with our ICP.
-   **Website:** Launch a marketing website with a clear value proposition and a prominent "Request a Demo" or "Join the Waitlist" call-to-action.

### Phase 2: Lead Generation & Product-Led Growth (Months 4-9)
**Goal:** Drive qualified leads and allow the product to sell itself.

-   **Product-Led Growth (PLG):**
    -   Offer a **14-day free trial** with a guided onboarding experience where the AI agent itself walks the new user through its capabilities.
    -   The trial will use sample data but will showcase the full power of the platform, including the Autonomous Mode.
-   **Webinars:** Host webinars on "The Future of AR: From Automation to Autonomy," featuring a live demo of FazeAR.
-   **Targeted Ads:** Run targeted LinkedIn and Google Ads campaigns focused on keywords like "AR automation for SMBs," "QuickBooks collections," and "AI in finance."

## 5. Sales Plan

### Pricing Strategy (SaaS Model)
-   **Pro Plan ($199/month):** For small teams (up to 2 users). Includes core automation, workflow management, conversational agent, and customizable Dunning Plans.
-   **Business Plan ($499/month):** For growing teams (up to 5 users). Includes everything in Pro, plus Advanced Analytics, AI Autonomous Mode, and AI-Powered Cash Application.
-   **Enterprise Plan (Custom Pricing):** For larger teams. Includes everything in Business, plus advanced features like Dispute Management, live API integrations, and the future Client Collaboration Portal.

### Sales Process
1.  **Inbound Funnel:** The majority of leads will come from the PLG free trial and webinar sign-ups.
2.  **Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs):** Our system will track trial usage. Users who engage with high-value features (like activating Autonomous Mode or customizing a dunning plan) will be flagged as PQLs.
3.  **Sales-Assist:** A small sales team will engage with PQLs to answer questions, provide personalized demos, and convert them to paying customers, focusing on the Business and Enterprise tiers.
4.  **Self-Service:** The Pro Plan will be primarily self-service, allowing smaller teams to sign up and pay directly after their trial expires.

By focusing on the unique, powerful, and intuitive experience of our AI agent, we can carve out a significant niche in the SMB market and build a strong foundation for future growth.
