### Phase 3: Initial AI Integration & Simulation (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Integrate the Gemini API for the first time and build a simulation environment.

-   [x] **Conversational Analytics:** Implement a chat interface where users can ask the AI questions about the application's data (workflows, performance, etc.).
-   [x] **Webhook Simulation:** Create a `WebhookListener` component to simulate events from external systems like QuickBooks (new invoice) and Stripe (payment received).
-   [x] **Client Payment Portal:** Build a simple, client-facing web page to simulate a customer paying an invoice.

### Phase 4: Advanced UI & Analytics (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Enhance the UI with more sophisticated data visualizations and reporting tools.

-   [x] **Analytics View:** Create a dedicated analytics page for managers and admins.
-   [x] **Invoice Aging Report:** Build a detailed table showing the distribution of overdue invoices.
-   [x] **Collector Performance Report:** Create a report to track and compare the performance of collectors.

### Phase 5: AI-Powered Cash Application (COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Implement a powerful, enterprise-grade feature to automate a key AR task.

-   [x] **AI-Powered Cash Application:** Implement a panel where users can paste remittance info, and the AI will parse it into structured data for payment matching.

### Future Roadmap: Enterprise-Grade Capabilities

The following features would be the next logical steps to evolve FazeAR into a top-tier commercial product.

-   [x] **Upgrade to Full Tool-Based Agent:** Refactor the entire AI interaction model to use a single, powerful agent with a suite of "tools" (Function Calling). This is the foundation for true automation.
-   [ ] **Interactive Client Collaboration Portal:** Transform the payment portal into a secure, self-service hub where clients can interact directly with a client-facing version of the FazeAR agent to resolve their own queries.
